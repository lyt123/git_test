If the commit only exists in your local repository and has not been pushed to GitHub, you can amend the commit message with the git commit --amend command.

On the command line, navigate to the repository that contains the commit you want to amend.
Type git commit --amend and press Enter.
In your text editor, edit the commit message and save the commit. You can also add a co-author by adding a trailer to the commit. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple authors."
The new commit and message will appear on GitHub the next time you push.

You can change the default text editor for Git by changing the core.editor setting. For more information, see "Basic Client Configuration" in the Git manual.
