ommits / Changing a commit message

How can we help?

Changing a commit message
If a commit message contains unclear, incorrect, or sensitive information, you can amend it locally and push a new commit with a new message to GitHub. You can also amend a commit to add a co-author.

Rewriting the most recent commit message
You can change the most recent commit message using the git commit --amend command.

In Git, the text of the commit message is part of the commit. Changing the commit message will change the commit ID--i.e., the SHA1 checksum that names the commit. Effectively, you are creating a new commit that replaces the old one.

Commit has not been pushed online
If the commit only exists in your local repository and has not been pushed to GitHub, you can amend the commit message with the git commit --amend command.
